<h1> 2 = Squid </h1>
<P><h2>Squid are a abuntant food source for fish off Nantucket. 
    These lures are espshaly good when trooling as sea weed is very hard to get stuck on the lure.
Also when trolling you are able to jig the rod to make the tenticals move in and out. 
This makes the squid look real and helps to trick the Bluefish into eating the lure.    </h2></P>
